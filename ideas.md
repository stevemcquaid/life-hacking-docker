Hey yall - I just started pulling together content for a talk im giving at a local conference: https://indycode.amegala.com/Sessions/580. I was hoping to get feedback on what others would find interesting.  The talk is centered around using docker containers to automate tasks in day-to-day life. I was wondering if you have any strong opinions of which of the following projects sound interesting/are things you would use:

  - Graph of internet speedtest over time (live)
  - Rendering markdown as pdf
  - Viewing preview of github markdown locally
  - Terminal-based chat combining: google hangouts, facebook, slack, irc, xmpp, twitter, etc
  - Portable vim editer with golang autocomplete
  - Unlock read-only pdfs
  - Batch renaming pdfs using metadata for title and author
  - Setup simple reverse proxies to expose various services securely for development
  - Terminal-based one time passcode generator (same as google auth/authy)
  - Terminal-based file downloader from dropbox
  - Terminal-based dropbox file structure browser
  - Terminal-based stock ticket
  - Terminal-based crypto-currency ticker
  - Terminal-based crypto-currency trader
  - Auto-mount veracrypt/truecrypt volumes securely
  - Terminal-based postgresql db viewer
  - Pihole/custom dns resolver
